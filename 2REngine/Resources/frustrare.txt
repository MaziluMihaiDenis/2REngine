Haven't you asked the same question earlier today and haven't I told you there that this is a generic exception 
happening when you somewhere pass a nullpointer to OpenGL and then try to read from it? 
Either something in the code that you do not show causes the problem, or vertexSrc is not a valid string. 
Keep in mind that OpenGL commands aren't directly executed, 
but stored in a command buffer that gets executed at some point. 
So any pointer that you pass to OpenGL before this block might cause the problem. -BDL
