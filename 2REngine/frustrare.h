//	Aici va fi toata frustrarea din codul acesta minunat

// For the sins I am about to commit, may James Gosling forgive me

// I dedicate all this code, all my work, to my wife, Darlene,
// who will have to support me and our three children and
// the dog once it gets released into the public.

// sometimes I believe compiler ignores all my comments

// When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing
// Now, God only knows

// My code is 50/50, sometime it works, sometimes it doesn't

// The compiler doesn't have enough error descriptions for my errors
